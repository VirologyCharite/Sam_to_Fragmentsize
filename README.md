# Sam_to_Fragmentsize

## Summary
`fragsize.py` takes a modified samfile and gives out the ID of each pair of reads and the length of the fragment they originate from. `sum.py` takes this output and plots it in a historgram, giving the mean, the standard deviation, the maximum and the minimun fragmentlength.

## Reasoning
This is being done in order to judge if the laboratory steps can be optimised, in particular fragmentation and size exclusion.

## Fragsize.py
- Samfiles of paired end reads mapped to a reference have to be given to this program. All IDs where only one of the two paired end reads map are being ignored. So far, samfiles used have been generated by geneious an exported as .sam.
- The samfile generated by mapping hast to be modified before giving it to `fragsize.py`. The first three lines of the samfile have to be replaced by this line: 'name	flag	rname	position	mapq	cigar	rnext	pnext	tlen	sequence	qual	filename'
